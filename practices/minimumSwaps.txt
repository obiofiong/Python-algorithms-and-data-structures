You are given an unordered array consisting of consecutive integers  [1, 2, 3, ..., n] without any duplicates. You are allowed to swap any two elements. Find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array in ascending order.

Example


Perform the following steps:

i   arr                         swap (indices)
0   [7, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6]   swap (0,3)
1   [2, 1, 3, 7, 4, 5, 6]   swap (0,1)
2   [1, 2, 3, 7, 4, 5, 6]   swap (3,4)
3   [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 5, 6]   swap (4,5)
4   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6]   swap (5,6)
5   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
It took  swaps to sort the array.

Explanation 0

Given array 
After swapping  we get 
After swapping  we get 
After swapping  we get 
So, we need a minimum of  swaps to sort the array in ascending order.
